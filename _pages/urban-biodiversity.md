## Urban Biodiversity Research

Urban areas represent one of the fastest-growing habitat types globally, creating novel environments that filter species in unique ways. My research in urban biodiversity examines how urbanization affects species composition, community structure, and ecosystem functions.

### Key Research Questions

- How do urban environmental filters select for certain species traits?
- What mechanisms drive biodiversity patterns across urban-rural gradients?
- How can we design cities to maximize biodiversity conservation?
- What is the role of urban green spaces in maintaining ecological connectivity?

### Current Projects

#### Urban Pollinators and Plant-Pollinator Networks

This project investigates how urbanization affects pollinator communities and their interactions with plants. Using a combination of field surveys and network analysis, we're examining how urban development alters the structure and function of plant-pollinator networks.

#### Urban Heat Islands and Biodiversity

Urban areas are typically warmer than surrounding rural areas due to the urban heat island effect. This project explores how these temperature differences affect species distribution, phenology, and community composition across cities.

### Methods

My research employs a range of methodological approaches:

- Field surveys across urban-rural gradients
- Experimental manipulation of urban habitat features
- GIS and remote sensing analyses of urban landscapes
- Statistical modeling of biodiversity patterns
- Meta-analyses of global urban biodiversity literature
