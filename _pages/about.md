## Biography

Hi there! I'm an ecologist interested on urban ecosystems and conservation biology. Currently, I'm a Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) Postdoc Mobility fellow at TU Munich at the [Urban Productive Ecosystems](https://upe-lab.de/) and a guest scientist at the [Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL](https://www.wsl.ch/de/mitarbeitende/casanell/). I am working on understanding how social-ecological drivers impact biodiversity patters, ecological processes and anture's contributions to people in the project [BiodiverCities](https://www.lss.ls.tum.de/en/upe/forschung/biodivercities/).

Besides, I am also part of the following research projects: [SNF Synergia PAPPUS](https://www.wsl.ch/en/projects/plants-and-people-in-urban-green-space-pappus/), aimed at understanding plant-people interactions; the [DFG project CityBees](https://www.lss.ls.tum.de/en/upe/research/citybees/), researching bee diversity and nutrition under urban heat stress; and the [StMELF project StreuWiklim](https://www.lss.ls.tum.de/en/upe/research/streuwiklim/), investigating traditional orchard meadows under climate change.

I have a pation for botany and insect enthomology (I am an active member of [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/joan57) and a contributor to InfoFlora), as well as for history.
