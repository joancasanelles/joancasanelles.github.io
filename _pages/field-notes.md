## Field work and community science

This page contains my work on iNaturalist and field work.

### iNaturalist Contributions

I'm an active iNaturalist user, contributing observations of plants, insects, and other taxa from urban and natural areas. My observations help build a broader understanding of species distributions and phenology.
