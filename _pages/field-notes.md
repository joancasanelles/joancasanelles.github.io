## Field Observations & Citizen Science

This page contains field notes, observations, and citizen science contributions from my ecological fieldwork. As an ecologist with broad taxonomic interests, I regularly document biodiversity observations during both research and personal activities.

### iNaturalist Contributions

I'm an active iNaturalist user, contributing observations of plants, insects, and other taxa from urban and natural areas. My observations help build a broader understanding of species distributions and phenology.

### Recent Field Expeditions

#### Urban Pollinator Surveys in Munich
*June 2024*

Field notes and observations from recent surveys of urban green spaces in Munich, focusing on bee and butterfly diversity in community gardens.

#### Alpine Plant Communities
*August 2023*

Documentation of plant diversity along elevation gradients in the Swiss Alps, with particular focus on the impacts of climate change on alpine communities.

### Citizen Science Projects

Beyond my research, I actively participate in and support several citizen science initiatives focused on biodiversity monitoring:

- **City Nature Challenge**: Annual participation in this global urban biodiversity event
- **Pollinator Monitoring**: Contribution to long-term monitoring of urban pollinator populations
- **Phenology Tracking**: Documentation of flowering and emergence times in response to climate variation
