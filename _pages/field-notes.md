## Taxonomic interests, field work and community science

This page contains my work on iNaturalist and field work. While I am not a taxonomist, I am a motivated naturalists. My taxonomic interests cover plants, and several insect groups such as bees, cavity-nesting wasps, butterflies, grasshoppers and dragonflies. 

### iNaturalist and Infoflora Contributions

I'm an active iNaturalist user, contributing observations of plants, insects, and other taxa from urban and natural areas. My observations help build a broader understanding of species distributions and phenology.
