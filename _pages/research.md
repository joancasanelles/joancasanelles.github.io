My research focuses on understanding the complex dynamics of biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes, particularly urban environments. I combine field studies, experimental approaches, and advanced modeling techniques to investigate:

## [Urban Biodiversity](/research/urban-biodiversity/)
Investigating how cities filter species and what this means for conservation in an increasingly urbanized world.

## [Predictive Modelling](/research/predictive-modelling/)
Developing statistical and machine learning approaches to predict biodiversity patterns and responses to environmental change.

## [Socio-eco-evolutionary Dynamics](/research/socio-eco-dynamics/)
Studying how social, ecological, and evolutionary processes interact in urban ecosystems.

## [Species Interactions](/research/species-interactions/)
Examining competitive, parasitic, and mutualistic interactions between species in urban environments.

My research seeks to provide actionable insights for urban planning, conservation strategies, and environmental policy.
